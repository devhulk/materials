# Agile and Scrum

Agile is a way to run a software development project so that we can have deliverable pieces of the large software project every couple of weeks vs tackling everything and not delivering until the software is considered "done". 

The business considering a software project "done" could take years. 

Instead we break down project tasks into "user stories", prioritizing these user stories so we know what needs to be worked on first. Then we continuously deliver these user stories over a short period of time, usually two weeks.

Talk briefly about how things were before...

## Waterfall

Waterfall is another way of running software development projects and was useful when it was really expensive to change the direction of a software project. Now its not expensive to change so this process has a couple of drawbacks.

In Waterfall there are four distinct phases...
  1. Analysis
  2. Design
  3. Build
  4. Test

If time was running out on the project the thing that got cut was testing (not good)
You don't really know where your are in the project because phase 3 and 4 probably will take 80% of the time.
Also, you don't see problems until to late because when you start testing your software is when you see if its really what you need or not. By this time its to late to make changes which makes this approach a lot more risky for the business or customer because of high pivot cost.

## Tie it back

With the Agile approach we take all 4 phases and combine them from the beginning of the project. This means we have improved software quality because we are testing from day one. We know where we are in the project because if you have completed 1/2 of the features than you are halfway through the project. Vs being in the Build Phase of Waterfall which would seem that would mean you were over 50% of the way done, when that is not the case. Risk is greatly reduced because we are getting feedback from the beginning. Also, we can't forget that the customer is happier because they can make changes without it costing them an arm and a leg.

# What is Scrum?

Scrum is a specific way of implementing the Agile Software development approach.
We are going to focus on the elements of Scrum that are going to most effect you as a Software Developer. Also we are going to briefly discuss 'Design Thinking' and how that impacts how we think about writing software.

Scrum Philosophy (Values)
  A Scrum team must have 
    * commitment
    * courage
    * focus
    * openness
    * respect

  Scrum team members living this philosophy helps to facilitate trust.

  A traditional Scrum team features a Product Owner, Development Team (Us), and Scrum Master.

High Level Role Definitions
  * Product Owner - Manages the Product Backlog
  * Development Team - Handles the work of incrementally delivering the software product.
  * Scrum Master - Ensures Scrum principles are being applied. Helping the Product manager with Backlog and assisting Development Team by helping with removing obstacles and/or helping with product development. Also facilitating Scrum events. Also working with team to make sure we have a clear definition of "done" for an increment of work.

Scrum Events
  * Sprint
  * Sprint Planning
  * Daily Scrum
  * Sprint Review

Scrum Artifacts
  * Product Backlog
  * Sprint Backlog
  * Increment
